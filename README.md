# Serilog.Sinks.BrowserHttp

A Serilog sink for client-side Blazor that posts batched events using the browser's HTTP stack. These can be sent to any remote HTTP endpoint, including the app's origin server. A companion package, _Serilog.AspNetCore.ClientRelay_, is also published from this repository, and can be used to relay events from the client to Serilog running in the ASP.NET Core server process.
